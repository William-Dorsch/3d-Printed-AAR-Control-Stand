# 3d-Printed-AAR-Control-Stand
This is a collection of 3d print files, parts, and code to make a functional train controller for PC games.  This specific set of files is to build an older EMD style AAR stand, such as that of a gp38 or sd40, which uses the EMD master controller and 26C brakes.

NOTE:  THIS IS A WIP - I DONT GUARANTEE ANY / ALL OF THIS WILL WORK FOR YOU<br/>

Held in this collectioin are the parts neccesary to create a functional, scaled down replica of an EMD style AAR control stand.  Whilst most of this is 3d printed, some parts are required:<br/>
-Arduino (leonardo for keyboard input support, uno for everything else is fine, although perhaps a mega if you want the light dials to work)
-50 #4 1/2" screws to be safe (you can buy two boxes of 25 from Ace for 5 bucks<br/>
-20 25mm m5 bolts + nuts<br/>
-assorted springs (such as those in this [listing](https://www.amazon.com/Dianrui-Compression-Assortment-Mechanical-K-P-051-300/dp/B0BVTDP29W/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1Z8HTDOO6KJDT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oHy4p09mCgR5R9tJeMvafSmaimV27RqPbNc8a76NEi9gId0GbQ0-mFv7xkux6p_HldYLD7ykHocZwnZYJc69XgbsGTPURyM9-Ia0_W9cIk8DCBFFz235mHCBQnvv8EpMLB1yg8k2vrT-adIumr2WFQLodXUnIkaN8t_pfCaZOCTMjIxltTjN41FEv2KlKmHo0jsWvMKlNdu-i2ThP3O9crXg-MtC3w-oXwB9DgcnpTM.B08F1PWAYexsd8RsDaBqsziQ9km8X-P6sNOm_ZDaXP4&dib_tag=se&keywords=springs&qid=1766536435&sprefix=spring%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-3&th=1) <br/>
-5 potentiometers ([digikey part # PDB12-H4301-103BF-ND](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/bourns-inc/PDB12-H4301-103BF/3780664), I suggest buying a couple spares in case something goes wrong while oldering (ask me how I know))<br/>
-1 cherry MX switch (i use brownns) for the horn lever, and potentially the buttons as well<br/>
-6x microswitch (unknown make, will fix later)<br/>
-a soldering iron<br/>
