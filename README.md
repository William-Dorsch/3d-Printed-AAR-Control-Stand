# 3d-Printed-AAR-Control-Stand
This is a collection of 3d print files, parts, and code to make a functional train controller for PC games.  This specific set of files is to build an older EMD style AAR stand, such as that of a gp38 or sd40, which uses the EMD master controller and 26C brakes.

NOTE:  THIS IS A WIP - I DONT GUARANTEE ANY / ALL OF THIS WILL WORK FOR YOU
Held in this collectioin are the parts neccesary to create a functional, scaled down replica of an EMD style AAR control stand.  Whilst most of this is 3d printed, some parts are required:

Arduino (leonardo for keyboard input support, uno for everything else is fine, although perhaps a mega if you want the light dials to work)
50 #4 1/2" screws to be safe (you can buy two boxes of 25 from Ace for 5 bucks
20 25mm m5 bolts + nuts
assorted springs (such as those in this listing _____________
5 potentiometers (digikey part # PDB12-H4301-103BF-ND, I suggest buying a couple spares in case something goes wrong while oldering (ask me how I know))
1 cherry MX switch (i use brownns) for the horn lever, and potentially the buttons as well
6x microswitch (check again)
a soldering iron
